# Object-detection-using-Frational-Gain-Kalman-FIlter
- In this project, we studied the object tracking problem in video signals and implemented method  ”object tracking using fractional-gain kalman filter”
- Background extraction has been used to retrieve the true position of the object. 
- background extraction is not accurate for all the object detection, since the paper focus on vehicle tracking. And for some of the video sources, its difficult to extract the background.
- Fractional-gain kalman filter is said to be 17% better then conventional kalman filter in terms of accuracy and responsiveness.
